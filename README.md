# Text Generation and Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

This project demonstrates the use of state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers for **Text Generation** and **Sentiment Analysis**. The models used in this project include **DistilBERT**, **GPT-2**, and **TinyLlama**. The project also explores **Zero-Shot**, **One-Shot**, and **Few-Shot** classification techniques for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generates text based on a given prompt using **GPT-2** and **TinyLlama** models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies text into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) using **DistilBERT** model.
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Classifies text into predefined categories without any labeled examples.
- **One-Shot Classification**: Classifies text with one labeled example for reference.
- **Few-Shot Classification**: Classifies text with a few labeled examples for guidance.

## Models Used

1. **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster version of BERT for sentiment analysis.
2. **GPT-2**: A large pre-trained language model for text generation.
3. **TinyLlama**: A variant of Llama model optimized for chat-based applications.
